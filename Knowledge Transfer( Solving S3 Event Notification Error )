 ==============================================================================
**Steps:**
# Here we are going to solve the Event Configuration error which occurred when we were setting the Event notifications.
# To overcome this error we are going to enter some details in SNS topic so follow the steps…
Step 1 ( Setting up Access policy )
# Go to your SNS topic and open it
	After opening the SNS topic click on edit
	Scroll down you will see access policy click on it 
# Here we are going to enter a JSON script to make it work 
# Amazon AWS has provided some sample example of JSON script which you can use it 
Link : https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/ways-to-add-notification-config-to-bucket.html 
# Down I have provided a sample script…

JSON Script :::::
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Id": "mynotifications",
  "Statement": [
    {

          "aws:SourceArn": "arn:aws:s3:::mybluwbhalebucket"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}

# Replace the Bold Items with your SNS Details
# Replace ID – with your SNS name
# Replace resource – with your bucket ARN ID
# Replace aws:sourceArn – with you bucket name
# After changing paste it in access policy section and save it
Step 2 ( Setting Event Notification )
# After saving SNS access policy come back to bucket and open event notification now follow the steps…
	In event notification click create notification
	Now enter the notification name
# You can specify the notification name as per your need for what the notification if for Eg. Accounts, bills, etc…
	Next in event types section you have to select the services you want notifications

	Now click save changes
# Now after saving you will not see the error and it will run smoothly…
Step 3 ( Enabling Event Bridge )
# After saving event notification we have to enable event bridge for allowing notifications to Email ID
# You will see amazon event bridge just below the event notification click on it..
	After clicking edit Enable the notifications
	Then Save the changes
Step 4 ( Adding Element to check )
# In this part we will again have to upload some files to check whether the event notification is working properly or not…
# You can upload the Free-CSS files for practice which you have downloaded before…	
	Firstly click on your bucket and open it
	Then go to objects tab
	Then click on upload
	In flies and folder section click on add files

**Explanation:**
The error message "Unable to validate the following destination configurations" occurs within software applications or systems when attempting to set up destinations, such as APIs, services, or external servers. This message indicates that the system is unable to confirm the correctness of the provided configuration settings for a specific destination. The validation process fails because the information entered does not meet the system's requirements or expectations. This issue can arise due to incorrect configuration data, mismatched data types, missing information, syntax errors, network/connectivity problems, changes in the external service or API, or security-related limitations. To address this error, one should meticulously review and amend the configuration settings by ensuring data accuracy, matching data types, completing mandatory fields, and adhering to syntax guidelines. Consulting documentation, seeking support, or engaging with relevant communities can be helpful if resolving the problem independently proves challenging. Ultimately, the aim is to troubleshoot and rectify configuration discrepancies, enabling successful validation of the destination configuration by the system.
