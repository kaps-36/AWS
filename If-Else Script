Discription:  In this we are going to create a script which will show us how if/else statement executes a block of code if a specified condition is true.If the condition is false, another block of code can be executed.
The if/else statement is a part of "Conditional" Statements, which are used to perform different actions based on different conditions.
In Shell Script we have the following conditional statements:
	--> Use if to specify a block of script to be executed, if a specified condition is true
	--> Use else to specify a block of script to be executed, if the same condition is false

Code:
--> #! /bin/bash
--> echo Hi,welcome to Hyderabad Motor driving school
--> echo Register to your name here
--> read name
--> echo welcome $name
--> echo May I know your age
--> read age
--> if [ $age -ge 18 ]  #using if else command
--> then
        	echo you are eligible for driving
--> else
        	echo you are not eligible for driving
--> fi #you have to reverse the command to close it

Output:

1st Condition
--> ./greeting.sh
--> Hi,welcome to Hyderabad Motor driving school
--> Register to your name here
--> Kashif Quadri
--> welcome Kashif Quadri
--> May I know your age
--> 22
--> you are eligible for driving

2nd Condition
--> ./greeting.sh
--> Hi,welcome to Hyderabad Motor driving school
--> Register to your name here
--> Kashif Quadri
--> welcome Kashif Quadri
--> May I know your age
--> 15
--> you are not eligible for driving

Explanation:
In the first condition the statement is true where script show us that the age enter by the user is coreect and he is applicable for the driving, whereas in second it shows the age enter is not applicable for driving.
So in this script in first condition we have used "If condition" to show it's True and in second we have use "Else condition" to show it's False.
